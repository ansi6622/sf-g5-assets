## Goal:
Apply Ruby knowledge to finishing out the CLI app

## Objectives
* Build nested conditionals for handling two menus with same commands
* Construct nested and related data structures for projects and tasks in projects

## Prerequisite
* [Basic Ruby lessons](/lessons/basic-ruby/deliverable) - or equivalent
* [CLI- looping lesson](/lessons/todo-cli/02-cli)

## Materials
* git repository: git@github.com:gschool-g5/todo-cli.git

----------

## Gain Attention
The app doesn't yet do all that we would like it too. Now we are going to have to use
our Ruby knowlege to make it a better app

## Inform learner of objective
* Hold state about whether we are editing an project
* Work with more complex and nested conditional statement to make menus
* Build data structures to related projects to tasks in those projects

## Stimulate recall of prior information
Let's look at the application we built in the last iteration. How do they map to
stories.

## We do
* Have people talk about the problems that they ran into
* Who got to stretch exercises?
* Look at an example from each stretch on the screens

__BREAK IN AN HOUR TO CHECK PEOPLE'S PROGRESS & brainstorm__
__CHECK IN AT HOUR 2__
__MOVE TO NEXT LESSON WHEN 5 PEOPLE ARE DONE__

## You Do
* Get tests running one at a time:
  * convert `xit` to `it`
  * make that test pass
  * continue

## Stretch exercises:
* Complete stretch exercises in previous lessons
* Change the todo app to use alternate one character commands:
    * Write tests, one at a time, that use these one letter commands
    * Make them pass
    * Move to the next test
* Think about what other things you could do to make the command line app
easier. Write or change tests and then implement it.
