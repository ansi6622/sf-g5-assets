### Building a Command Line Application - Things to think about

  * User interface
  * Commands

### What is flow control?

  * if / else
  * How do you know where you are and how do you get around the program?
  * Every program is a combination of code and data and how those two interact

### Data Structures

* Using Arrays vs Hashes vs Objects
  * With objects you have both data and behavior
  * Querying (Finding)

### Writing RSpec Tests

* Break tests up into small steps. Should only be testing for one thing.
* Parts of a test:
  * Set Up
  * Do the stuff
  * Make an assertion
  * Always see a test go red before it goes green

### IO Class

* gets / puts
* input / output
* file
* $stdout (is a global variable)

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

* Don't build a feature you don't need
* Given business requirements, don't build features that are not part of those
requirements

### While Loops / Infinite Loops

* Using Flags
  * variables to keep a loop running and direct an app
* Nested Loops
  * When you quit one loop, you do not break out of outter loops
* Using break to quit a loop (exit freaks out RSpec)
