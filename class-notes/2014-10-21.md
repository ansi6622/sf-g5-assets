### Convention Over Configuration

#### What
A software design paradigm which seeks to decrease the number of decisions
that developers need to make, gaining simplicity, but not necessarily losing
flexibility.

Example: You have a class "Sale" in your model. The corresponding table in your
 database should be named "sales".

#### Why?

Some frameworks need multiple configuration files, each with many settings.
These provide information specific to each project, ranging from URLs to mappings
between classes and database tables. A large number of configuration files with
lots of parameters is often difficult to maintain. By using "default" naming
conventions, developers can minimize potential errors.

## Terminal Commands

#### tab - tab completion
* Will complete the name of a unique file or directory

#### cd - change directory
```bash
  cd name-of-directory
 ```
#### ls - list directory
* Will list the files and directories of your current working directory
#### pwd - print working directory
#### mkdir - make new directory
```bash
  mkdir name-of-new-directory
```
#### mkdir -p
```bash
  mkdir -p ParentDirectory/new-directory
```
#### rm - remove
```bash
  rm name-of-file-to-delete.txt #USE WITH CAUTION!
```
#### mv - move a file OR rename a file 
```bash
  # move a file
  mv app/name-of-file.txt home/name-of-file.txt
  
  # rename a file
  mv old-name-of-file.txt new-name-of-file.txt
```
#### cp - copy a file
```bash
  cp file-to-copy.txt name-of-new-copy.txt
```
#### cat - show contents of a file
```bash
  cat name_of_file.txt
```
#### touch - create an empty file
```bash
  touch name_of_new_file.txt
```

### Absolute paths vs Relative paths

#### Absolute path starts with a forward slash (/)
example: /Users/jfoley/Projects/gschool/todo

#### Tilda (~) is an alias for your home folder 
example: ~/Projects/gschool/todo

/Users/jfoley/Projects/gschool/todo is equal to ~/Projects/gschool/todo

#### A relative path is relative to your working directory

* If your working directory (pwd) is 'Projects' than the path 'gschool/todo'
is relative to where you are, rather than relative to your root directory.


### Bundler - Bundle Install

* If your gemfile is a sort of shopping list of gems you need for your app, than
think of bundler as a personal shopper. Bundler goes to the internet and gathers
up all the gems listed in your Gemfile. You ask it to do this when you type:

```bash
  bundle install
```

#### MVC
* Model
* View
* Controller
