## Convention Over Configuration

## Terminal Commands

* tab - tab completion
* cd - change directory (cd *name of directory you want to go to*)
* ls - list directory
* pwd - print working directory
* mkdir - make new directory (mkdir *whatever you name directory*)
* mkdir -p - make a parent directory (mkdir -p *ParentDirectory/directory*)
* rm - remove (rm *name of file or directory to remove*) USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!!
* mv - move a file OR rename a file (mv name_of_file_to_move.txt name_of_new_directory)
  OR mv file_to_rename.txt new_name_of_file.txt)
* cp - copy a file (cp copy_this_file.txt new_copy_of_file.txt)
* cat - show contents of a file (cat name_of_file.txt)
* touch - create an empty file (touch  name_of_new_file.txt)

## Absolute paths vs Relative paths

#### Absolute path starts with a forward slash (/)

* example: /Users/jfoley/Projects/gschool/todo
* Tilda (~) is an alias for your home folder example: ~/Projects/gschool/todo
* /Users/jfoley/Projects/gschool/todo is equal to ~/Projects/gschool/todo

#### A relative path is relative to your working directory

* If your working directory (pwd) is 'Projects' than the path 'gschool/todo'
is relative to where you are, rather than relative to your root directory.
