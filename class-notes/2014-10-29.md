#### RSpec

* What is RSpec?

  * RSpec is a testing tool for the Ruby programming language. You run RSpec
    tests by typing:

```bash
  rspec
```
Please read this [pdf](http://g5.gschool.it/rspec.pdf) about RSpec. First is the
overview, scroll down about halfway for the example slides.

#### More on Ruby Collections

* [Arrays](http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-part-arrays/)
* [Hashes, Sets, Ranges](http://www.sitepoint.com/guide-ruby-collections-ii-hashes-sets-ranges/)

#### [Enumerables](http://www.eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-map-select-and-other-enumerable-methods)

##### A few to get you started:

* .each returns the original object it was called on
* .each_with_index passes not just the current item but whatever position (or index)
in the array the item was located in.
* .select returns a new array filled only with items from the original array where
the block you gave it returned true
* .map or .collect return a new array filled with whatever gets returned by the
 block each time it runs.

##### More handy methods

* .any? returns true/false (see the question mark?) and answers the question,
"do ANY of the elements in this object pass the test in my block?".
If your block returns true on any time it runs, any? will return true.
* .all? returns true/false and answers the question, "do ALL the elements of
this object pass the test in my block?".
Every time the block runs it must return true for this method to return true.
* .none? returns true only if NONE of the elements in the object return true
when the block is run.
* .find returns the first item in your object for which the block returns true.
