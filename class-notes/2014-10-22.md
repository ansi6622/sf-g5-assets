#### Chrome / Atom Favorite Keyboard Shortcuts

* cmd+tab = toggle through open apps on you mac
* ctrl+tab = toggle through tabs in Atom and Chrome
* cmd+~ = toggle between two open windows for an application (Chrome, Atom, etc)
* cmd+R = Refresh a browser window
* cmd+S = save your file
* cmd+Q = quit a program
* cmd+w = close a page or file

Adding the 'shift' key to any keyboard shortcuts will reverse the order in which
you are toggling through items. Try these out in Atom as well and see which ones
you like!
