#### Chrome / Atom Favorite Keyboard Shortcuts

* cmd+tab = toggle through open apps on you mac
* ctrl+tab = toggle through tabs in Atom and Chrome
* cmd+~ = toggle between two open windows for an application (Chrome, Atom, etc)
* cmd+R = Refresh a browser window
* cmd+S = save your file
* cmd+Q = quit a program
* cmd+W = close a page or file
* cmd+K = in terminal, cmd+k will clear all text from the current window
* cmd+T = in ATOM, allows you to search for a file in your current project
* cmd+F = in Chrome, use this to search for keywords on a page

Adding the 'shift' key to these keyboard shortcuts will reverse the order in which
you are toggling through items. Try these out and see which ones you like!
