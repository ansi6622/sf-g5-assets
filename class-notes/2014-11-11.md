### Refactoring

[Refactoring Out Methods](/lessons/todo-cli/05-refactor-methods/deliverable)
[Refactoring Out Separate Classes](/lessons/todo-cli/06-refactor-classes/deliverable)

#### What you will practice

* Breaking code into methods
* Pulling methods into separate classes
* Methods less than 5 lines
* Classes less that 75 lines

### What does persisting data mean?

This means that the data survives after the program with which it was
created has ended. (In this case, our CLI Todo).

* Storing a data structure

### Files in your TODO cli
