###  Git Commands Review

##### Master is the pointer to the most recent location in history
##### HEAD pointer indicates current location in history

* git log
  * lists commit messages with date, author, and SHA-1

* git diff
  * shows what changes have been made in a file after saving, but
  before committing

* git checkout (is a rollback)
  * relocates the HEAD
  * takes an argument
    * SHA or a branch name

* git reset HEAD^ --hard
  * Throws away the most recent commit
  * HEAD^ tells git what point in history to reset to (in this case,
    take me back by one commit)
  * The ^ indicates how many commits you want to throw away
    * example: ^^ would go back two commits.
  * reset --hard throws things away. Be careful!

## Debugging Tips!

### Use the .class method to know what kind of object you have

* What do you have?
* What do you want?
* What are you actually asking your program to give you.

#### EXAMPLE:

```ruby
  puts @deck.class
  # => BlackJack::Deck

  puts @deck.shuffle.class
  # => Array
```

### Using `p` to inspect elements

#### EXAMPLE:

```ruby
  p @deck # => inspects an object (in this case, an instance variable)
```

### When reading a Class, Ruby reads the entire class definition before executing

* Unlike a method, which is read and executed top to bottom, methods in a Class
can be executed in any order.

### When accessing data within a Class, you must access it through a method

```ruby
  class Cat # => Blueprint

    def initialize(name)
      @name = name
    end

    def name
      @name
    end
  end

  cat = Cat.new("Chubler") # => object of the Cat class
  name = cat.name # => method used to access the data (i.e. cat name)
```

### Goals

#### Understanding State

* initializing an object
* being able to use the state of an object
* understanding that an object has different behaviors based on state

```ruby
# main scope

class Scopes
  # beginning of class scope
  # this is a blueprint of the class object  
  # not an actual object of the class itself

  def initialize
    @instance_variable = "yo"
  end

  def demo

    # beginning of method scope

    # method stuff here...

    1.times do |i|
      # beginning of block scope


      puts @instance_variable


      # end of block scope
    end
    # end of method scope
  end

  # more class stuff here...

  # end of class scope
end
# end main scope


scope = Scopes.new # => Actual object of the class itself
scope.demo # calling the method on the object

```
