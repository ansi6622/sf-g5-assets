###  Git Commands Review

##### Master is the pointer to the most recent location in history
##### HEAD pointer indicates current location in history

* git log
  * lists commit messages with date, author, and SHA-1

* git diff
  * shows what changes have been made in a file after saving, but
  before committing

* git checkout (is a rollback)
  * relocates the HEAD
  * takes an argument
    * SHA or a branch name

* git reset HEAD^ --hard
  * Throws away the most recent commit
  * HEAD^ tells git what point in history to reset to (in this case,
    take me back by one commit)
  * The ^ indicates how many commits you want to throw away
    * example: ^^ would go back two commits.
  * reset --hard throws things away. Be careful!

#### Use the method .class to know what kind of object you have

* What do you have?
* What do you want?
* What are you actually asking your program to give you.

#### EXAMPLE:

```ruby
  puts @deck.class
  # => BlackJack::Deck

  puts @deck.shuffle.class
  # => Array
```

## GOAL

### Understanding State

* initializing an object
* being able to use the state of an object
* understanding that an object has different behaviors based on state

```ruby
# main scope

class Scopes
  # beginning of class scope
  # this is a blueprint of the class object  
  # not an actual object of the class itself

  def initialize
    @instance_variable = "yo"
  end

  def demo

    # beginnign of method scope

    # method stuff here...

    1.times do |i|
      # beginning of block scope


      puts @instance_variable


      # end of block scope
    end
    # end of method scope
  end

  # more class stuff here...

  # end of class scope
end
# end main scope


scope = Scopes.new # => Actual object of the class itself
scope.demo # calling the method on the object

```
