#### A great reference for material is the [Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)

##### For the list below, please type the git command used for each action:

Also, write a brief description of what that command does and identify what part of
our rocket ship analogy it is in.

* Display your working directory?
* Initialize a git repository in a newly created local directory
* Display the status of a repository
* Identify if files are staged or not
* Add a file to the staging area
* Commit the contents of the staging area using the -m flag
* Commit using the -m flag with a multi-line description
* Push your local repository to github (assume your remote is already set)
* Add a remote to your repository (not part of rocket anaology)
* Change an existing remote
* Pull changes from a shared github repo to your local repo
* Show the history of a git repository
* Show a log of your commit history
* Roll back to a specific commit in history

#### You should understand the following:

* Git stores the differences not versions of whole files - it is a history
* How --hard differs from not using --hard
* Why using --hard should be used with care
* How undoing, discarding or changing commits affects code that has been pushed
to a different remote
