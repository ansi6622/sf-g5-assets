## Introduction to Git and GitHub

The two things developers do most:

* Collaberate
* Make mistakes

#### What is git?

Git is a version control system. It allows you to track changes you make to files
on your machine. This is helpful for when you screw things up! And you will. And
that's ok. Version control allows developers to revert back to a specific time
and place in your code. Sort of like a reset button.

#### What is GitHub?

Github is a web based service that hosts repositories on a server and allows
developers to easily collaborate. It is another place for source code management,
like git, but the two are NOT the same.

#### Git / GitHub Basic Flow

Create a new project using Terminal:

```bash
  mkdir < name-of-project >
  cd < name-of-project >
  git init #This initializes a git repository
  # Do stuff.
  git status
  git add < name-of-file >
  git commit -m "Commit message"
```
Before we can push our local repository to GitHub, we need to create a repo in
GitHub.

Pushing your project to GitHub:

* Go to GitHub
* Click the + at top right of profile and select 'New repository'
* Name the repo
* Add a brief description
* Click 'Create repository'
* Click the SSH tab and copy the SSH

Inside your project in Terminal do the following:

```bash
  git remote add origin < paste SSH >
  #Now we can push it to GitHub
  git push origin master
```
