## Introduction to Git and GitHub
* [The entire Pro Git book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

The two things developers do most:

* Collaberate
* Make mistakes

#### What is Git?

Git is a version control system. It allows you to track changes you make to files
on your machine. This is helpful for when you screw things up! And you will. And
that's ok. Version control allows developers to revert back to a specific time
and place in your code. Sort of like a reset button.

#### What is GitHub?

Github is a web based service that hosts repositories on a server and allows
developers to easily collaborate. It is another place for source code management,
like git, but the two are NOT the same.

#### Git / GitHub Basic Flow

Create a new project using Terminal:

```bash
  mkdir < name-of-project >
  cd < name-of-project >
  git init #This initializes a git repository
  # Do stuff.
  git status
  git add < name-of-file >
  git commit -m "Commit message"
```
Before we can push our local repository to GitHub, we need to create a repo in
GitHub.

Pushing your project to GitHub:

* Go to GitHub
* Click the + at top right of profile and select 'New repository'
* Name the repo
* Add a brief description
* Click 'Create repository'
* Click the SSH tab and copy the SSH

Inside your project in Terminal do the following:

```bash
  git remote add origin < paste SSH >
  #Now we can push it to GitHub
  git push origin master
```

## Ruby Basics

* [Everything is an object](http://g5.gschool.it/lessons/ruby-basics/1-objects/deliverable)
* [Varying with variables](http://g5.gschool.it/lessons/ruby-basics/2-variables/deliverable)
* [In the flow](http://g5.gschool.it/lessons/ruby-basics/3-flow/deliverable)
* [Strings](http://g5.gschool.it/lessons/ruby-basics/4-strings/deliverable)

#### [Variables](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_variables.htm)

* variables are written in snake_case
* can contain any alphanumeric characters and an underscore ( _ )
* cannot _start_ with a number
* local variable vs global variable vs instance variable

  * local variable

    * begin with a lower case letter or underscore
    * the scope of a local variable is limited

  * global variable

    * available everywhere (not recommended)
    * start with a $ ($i_am_a_global_variable)

  * instance variable

    * begin with the @ symbol
    * the scope of the instance variable is wider than a local, but is still
      limited.

#### Variables act like the things they hold

```irb
  #EXAMPLE 1

  var_1 = 1
  => 1
  var_2 = 4
  => 4
  var_1 + var_2
  => 5

  #EXAMPLE 2

  var_1 = "hello"
  => "hello"
  var_2 = "goodbye"
  => "goodbye"
  var_1 + var_2
  => "hellogoodbye"
  var_1 + " " + var_2
  => "hello goodbye"
```

Above, in EXAMPLE 1, our two variables are Integers and behave like Integers. In
EXAMPLE 2 we change those variables to Strings and they behave like Strings.

Play around with some Ruby variables and methods in irb and experiment with the
different types of objects.
