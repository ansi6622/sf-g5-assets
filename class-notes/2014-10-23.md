#### Stand Up

Spring - don't use it! Save yourself the trouble of having your app blow up.

  1) rails new <name-of-app> --skip-spring
  2) Remove the spring gem from you gemfile and bundle

#### RESTful Routes

Check out [this link](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) and go about
halfway down the page for a table that very clearly shows these routes.

#### Bundler

Bundler is a gem! And your personal gems shopper. Whenever you make changes to
your gemfile, clone an app, or new up an app you need to run 'bundle' in
your terminal (make sure you are in the right directory!). 

'bundle' is an alias for 'bundle install'. Either one is fine! Also, whenever you add gems or bundle,
you also need to kill your server by typing 'ctrl+C' and then 'rail s' to start it up again.

```bash
  bundle    #or bundle intall
            #ctrl+C to kill your server
  rails s   #to restart your server
```
