#### Stand Up

Spring - don't use it! Save yourself the trouble of having your app blow up.

Two ways to avoid Spring:

  1) rails new <name-of-app> --skip-spring
  2) Remove the spring gem from you gemfile and bundle

#### RESTful Routes

Check out [this link](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) and go about
halfway down the page for a table that very clearly shows these routes.

#### CRUD

* CREATE
* READ
* UPDATE
* DELETE

#### Bundler

Bundler is a gem! And your personal gems shopper. Whenever you make changes to
your gemfile, clone an app, or new up an app you need to run 'bundle' in
your terminal (make sure you are in the right directory!).

'bundle' is an alias for 'bundle install'. Either one is fine! Also, whenever you add gems or bundle,
you also need to kill your server by typing 'ctrl+C' and then 'rail s' to start it up again.

```bash
  bundle    #or bundle intall
            #ctrl+C to kill your server
  rails s   #to restart your server
```

#### [Relationships - Making Associations](http://g5.gschool.it/lessons/rails-tutorial/05-relationships-light/deliverable)

An ActiveRecord object in Ruby maps to a row in a database table and allows us
to manipulate the data in the table by manipulating the Ruby object.

#### ActiveRecord vs. Active Record

The ActiveRecord gem implements the Active Record design pattern.

Active Record is an object that wraps a row in a database table or view,
encapsulates the database access, and adds domain logic on that data.
- [Martin Fowler](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html)

#### Creating Data

```bash
user = User.new
user.first_name = “Joe”
user.save
or
user = User.create(first_name: “Joe”)
```

#### Reading Existing Data

* find method with an ID

```bash
user = User.find(1)
```

* handy methods
```bash
user = User.first
user = User.last
```

#### [Rails Console](http://g5.gschool.it/lessons/rails-tutorial/06-console/deliverable)

```bash
  rails console
  #OR
  rails c
```

To exit rails console:

```bash
  exit
  #OR
  ctrl D
```
